# Brief Overview

The goal of this small project was to use a neural network to classify breast cancer diagnoses in a dataset, 
and explore how adjusting the number of layers and neurons per layer affects model performance. Part of the point was to practice tuning the layer 
and number of neurons per layer using a loop. 

This expands a project in the IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate offered through Coursera.
